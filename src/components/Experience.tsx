              management, and increase the overall efficiency of the support
              team. These improvements facilitated easier maintenance and
              scalability of the POS software.

              Developed multiple Zoho plugins to integrate various tools
              directly into the main support dashboard. This integration reduced

              productivity by automating routine tasks.
